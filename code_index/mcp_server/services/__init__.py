"""Service layer for the MCP server implementation.

This module contains the business logic services that power the MCP server's
functionality. It provides these main services:

- CodeIndexService: Handles repository indexing and symbol querying
- SourceCodeFetchService: Manages source code retrieval operations
- RepoAnalyseService: Helps LLMs traverse codebase with todolist
- GraphAnalyzerService: Provides call graph analysis functionality

These services are designed as singletons and provide the core functionality
exposed through the MCP server's tools and resources.

Classes:
    CodeIndexService: Service for code repository indexing and symbol queries
    SourceCodeFetchService: Service for source code fetching operations
    RepoAnalyseService: Service for LLM-assisted codebase analysis
    GraphAnalyzerService: Service for call graph analysis
