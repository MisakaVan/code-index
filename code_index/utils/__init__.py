"""Utility modules for the code indexer.

This package provides utility functions and classes that support the core
functionality of the code indexer, including:

- Logging configuration and setup
- Custom JSON serialization for complex data types
- Testing utilities for data comparison and validation

The utilities are designed to be reusable across different components of
the code indexer and provide consistent behavior for common operations
like serialization, logging, and testing.
