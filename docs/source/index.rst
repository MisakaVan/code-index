code-index documentation
========================

A repository-level source code indexer that utilizes tree-sitter to parse source code files
and creates an index of function and method definitions and references. It supports multiple
programming languages including Python, C, and C++.

Features
--------

* **Multi-language support**: Index Python, C, and C++ source code
* **Function and method tracking**: Find definitions and references for functions and methods
* **Flexible storage**: Support for in-memory, JSON, and SQLite storage backends
* **Query interface**: Search for symbols by name, regex patterns, or exact matches
* **Tree-sitter powered**: Uses tree-sitter for accurate syntax analysis

Quick Start
-----------

Install the package:

(Note: Working In Progress)

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install code-index

Basic usage:

.. code-block:: python

   from code_index import CodeIndexer
   from code_index.language_processor import PythonProcessor
   from pathlib import Path

   # Create an indexer for Python code
   processor = PythonProcessor()
   indexer = CodeIndexer(processor)

   # Index a project
   project_path = Path("path/to/your/project")
   indexer.index_project(project_path)

   # Find all definitions of a function
   definitions = indexer.find_definitions("my_function")
   for defn in definitions:
       print(f"Found definition at {defn.file_path}:{defn.location.start_lineno}")
